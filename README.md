# project-DecisionTree
🌳 Customer Classification using Decision Tree Classifier This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer purchase behavior based on their demographic data. It demonstrates a simple yet effective classification model built using supervised machine learning.


🔍 Objective
To classify customers based on whether they will purchase a product using features such as:

Age

Estimated Salary

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier, train/test split, accuracy)

⚙️ Key Steps
Data Import & Exploration
Loaded customer dataset and explored key features and class balance.

Preprocessing

Selected relevant features

Split data into training and testing sets

Model Training
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.

Evaluation

Measured model accuracy

Visualized decision boundaries and decision tree structure

Visualization

Used decision regions to show how the model separates classes

Plotted the actual tree for interpretability

🎯 Outcome
Achieved a clear classification of customers based on purchase behavior. This kind of model can be used in:

Predictive marketing

Customer targeting

Business decision support
